Probability theory computes probabilities of complex events given the underlying base probabilities.

Statistics takes us in opposite direction.

we are given data that is generated by stocastic process.

we infer properties of underlying base probabilities.

The probability that an unbiased coin would generate sequance with 570 or more heads is extremely small from which we 
conclude with high confidance, that the coin is biased.

on other hand,|S1000|>=507 is quite likely. So getting 507 heads does not provide evidance that the coin is biased 

Statisics is about analyzing real-world data and drawing conclutions.

Examples
--------
1. Using polls to estimate public opinion
2. Performing A/B tests to design web pages
3. Estimating the rate of golbal warming
