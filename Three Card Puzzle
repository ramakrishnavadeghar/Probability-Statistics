Three Card puzzle
-----------------

Suppose we have three cards in a hat:

RB-One card is painted blue on one side and R on ther side

BB-One card is painted blue on both sides

RR- Once card is painted Red on both sides

So we have these cards in a hat, and we may mix them,

We pick a card at random and we put it on the table okay?

So here we have blue card on the table.

And the color of the side that facing is call it U.

it's B or R, okay?

So here is the bet that I'm suggesting we make

If other side of the card has a different color, I will pay you $1.

If other side of the card has same color, you pay me $1 okey?

And I think that this is fair.

Why do I think fair? Because suppose it's red, actually it's blue. So what can this card be?

It can be either blue on both sides or blue and red okey?

So there are two options, one is with the other side being red and one is with the other side is blue,

So They both have the same probability of happening,

So having a bet one to one is fair Okey?

So let's see this one.

Yeah, actually I got red, so I pay you $1.
