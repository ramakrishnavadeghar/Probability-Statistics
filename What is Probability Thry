What is Probabiliity Theory?
Probability is a mathamatical framework for computing the probability of complex events.

We will use the pseudo random number generators in numpy to simulate the coin flips

#Generate the sum of k coins flips, repeat that n times
def generate_counts(k=1000,n=100):
  X=2*(random.rand(k,n)>0.5)-1 #Generate the kXn matrix of +-1 rando  
  s=sum(X,axis=0)
  return S


Sk=x1+x2+....+xk
xi=-1 with the probability 1/2,xi=+1 with probability 1/2

Sk almost always in a ragne [-4 squareroot(K),+4 squareroot(K)]

What is probability theory?
It is the math involved in proving (precise virsion of ) the statements above
